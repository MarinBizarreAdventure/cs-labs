# CS Labs: Cryptography and Security Laboratories

Welcome to the CS Labs repository! This repository documents my laboratories related to cryptography and security at the university. It aims to provide insights into various cryptographic techniques, security principles, and their implementations in programming.

## Table of Contents

- [Laboratory 1: Caesar Cipher Implementation](lab_1_caesar_cipher/README.md)
- [Laboratory 2: Frequency Analysis of Letter Occurrences](lab_2_monoalphabetic_cipher_analysis/README.md)


## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these instructions to clone the repository, set up a virtual environment, and install the necessary dependencies.

### Prerequisites

- [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Cloning the Repository

To clone the repository, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MarinBizarreAdventure/cs-labs.git
cd cs-labs-cryptography
```

### Setting Up the Virtual Environment

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies for the project. You can set one up by following these steps:

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

### Installing Requirements

Once the virtual environment is activated, install the necessary dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Laboratories

### Setting Up the Virtual Environment for Each Lab

Each laboratory has its own virtual environment and requirements file located in its respective directory. Follow these steps to set up the virtual environment for any lab:

1. Navigate to the specific lab directory:
   ```bash
   cd lab_1_caesar_cipher  # For example, for Lab 1
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment for the lab:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install the lab-specific requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
